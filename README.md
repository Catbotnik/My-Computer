Appear with Music Script is bound to the image layer

Audio Scale X=Bass Y=Treble Script is bound to the scale axis

I'll update the code if i ever make a better version of it




partial credit goes to fug4life and araskan on the steam work shop, who's scripts i used as a base for what i needed, for the Audio Scale X=Bass Y=Treble Script and Appear with Music Script respectively
